some modifications  My husband and I like spicy food but I found this recipe as is is a little too spicy  I only use a     of the jalape os and cayenne pepper  I use   cans of the green chilies  I wanted my chili a little thicker so I pureed one can of the white beans and only used   cups of chicken broth  I also added a can of black beans and a can of corn  And finally since the cheese adds a lot of fat  rather than mixing it all in  I just sprinkle a little on top before eating  This is really delicious  Everyone I serve it too raves about it       DREGINEK   Sep              We loved this recipe but it is soooooo hot  Per a previous review  I cut down to   cans of beans  and only used     tsp of cayene pepper and added some sour cream to cool it down but still   HOT  I will make again but I will eliminate the jalapeno peppers altogether  I m not a huge fan of them anyways   cut the cumin down to   tsp and omit all cayenne pepper  Really  the taste is fabulous   if your not weak of tongue  I was practically sweating just eating a bowl  Still  will make again with my alterations     Food assembler   Feb              First of all Excellent the tase is quite unique  Two helpful hints  I put everything together before I even turned on the flame on my big pot  Also I put the cheese in last so that it would not burn on the bottom of the pot  Made it both ways and frankly both ways turned out the same with the surprise when you eat it the next day  WOW    HAWESA   Jun             I added a can of corn  used a can of cream of chicken in place of one can of chicken broth  used all mild green chilies instead of jalapenos  it came out perfectly spiced   and threw everything into the crockpot on high for   hours  I hand shredded the chicken at the end and put it back in  Delicious  Oh  and I also pureed one can of the white beans and that really helped to thicken things up     MASKSOFNOH   Oct              This is the BEST chili  By far my new favorite  It s the perfect amount of spice  very warm  I used pepperjack cheese and replaced   can of white beans with black beans  I added     c  sour cream at the end and topped with tomatoes  This is absolutely wonderful chili  thanks for a GREAT recipe     LADYJAYPEE   Jun             This is SO good  I just made it and am waiting for my husband to get home  if he doesn t hurry  it will be too late      We like hot spicey foods  but we don t like it so overpowering that the heat takes over the flavor  SO  I used only   tablespoons of the jalapenos and chopped them up very finely so they would be well distributed throughout the dish  I also used     tsp of cayenne pepper  This is perfect seasoning for us  I also only put in one can of chicken broth on the advice of other reviewers  and I added a  th can of beans to thicken it up a bit  Thank you  Cathy  It is great     twins      Jan             This soup is nothing short of awesome  My husband raved about this soup for   days  I did brown the cooked chicken w  the onions  didn t have white beans  just used   can navy beans     can dark red kidney beans  added some frozen corn and   can of cream of chicken  Then  since it was EXTREMELY spicy  quite a kick  and sort of thin  I added some diced potatoes to absorb some of the broth and  kick   My husband was getting it out of the pot before I even added the cheese  which I m sure is just as good sprinkled on top later  This recipe really surprised me on how it tasted like something you would get   a pricey restaurant  It smells really good when cooking and would be an awesome soup to serve   a party  and impress your guests   Way to go    PYTNPLACE   Jan              Yum   We loved this recipe  Made some changes  Used one pound all white meat ground turkey and   skinless  boned chicken breasts diced  Cooked the meat together with the seasonings  Added some chili powder to the seasoning  Reduced the cayenne to     teaspoon  To further lower fat I skipped the cheese and put     can beans in food processor and used this to thicken  Garnishes on side to use as desired were  cheese  tortilla chips  sour cream  salsa and red onion  Warms your tummy in this very chilly winter     Jeanette   Jan              OH MY GOSH  This was great    I used skinless  boneless chicken tenders instead of the cooked chicken  I sauted them until they were no longer pink  then added the onions  fresh garlic  chiles  and spices to the same saute pan   Then I dumped everything into a big stew pot  and simmered it for an hour or so  I also added about   tsps of Chili Powder  and substituted shredded Colby Jack cheese   This recipe got rave reviews from everyone  I served it with warm flour tortillas  and a huge salad  YUM  Will make this again     Make Roux   Put oil in a small pot over med heat  when warm add flour  and mix constantly  I use a whisk    When it starts durning golden  add water and keep stiring until it thickens   Take it off the heat  it s done       Dry Beans  Boil for    minutes then either continue boiling or strain and put in slow cooker until desired firmness   Strain when done    Can also be replaced with   oz of canned great northern beans    This will add a lot of salt  so consider lowering the amount of adobo    Better than bouillon can be dropped by replacing all water with chicken stock    Slow Cooker     Prepare base in slow cooker   Make roux and add to base  mix until smooth   Add spices to slow cooker  mix   Add bulk items    for frozen onions cook them in the roux pot for   ish minutes to soften them up    Cook for   hours    Add finish items and shred chicken    Add corn    Cook for additional hour    Stove top     Cook onions over med low heat in large pot until they re done    With frozen onions you might want to cook hit them with high heat at first to get them going and boil off the liquid    Add the spices while the onions are cooking     Cut the chicken up and add it and everything but the cheese   Bring it to a simmer for     minutes      Serve     Top with shredded mexican blend cheese  or probably whatever else you ve got around  while serving ", "tags": ["Southwestern"]},
