I followed the recipe in terms of ingredients, but here are a few extra things I did: I pounded my chicken breasts flat, cut them up into strips, and quickly stir fried them in a little olive oil and just a pinch of salt. Once they were almost cooked through, I splashed on a little bit of soy sauce and set them aside. I cooked my sliced onions in the butter, (instead of the eggs. I used PAM for those) Great flavor and gave the rice a little something too. When I combined all ingredients, I also added some green onion to this dish, red pepper, and red pepper flakes. Also! *Make sure your rice is cold when you cook this!* GREAT recipe, will use again and again. Thanks!
